## Overview
Gadget Heaven is an online platform for buying and selling electrical devices. We offer various product categories, including laptops, mobile phones, headphones, and watches. This project showcases fundamental React concepts and modern web development practices to deliver a dynamic and responsive user experience.

## React Fundamental Concepts Used
- **Hooks**: Usage of `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useLoaderData` for state management and side effects.
- **Event Handling**: Click events to handle product sorting, modal toggling, and deletion.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Conditional display of elements such as the cart items and modal dialogs.
- **Props**: Passing data and event handlers between components to ensure component communication.

## Data Handling and Management
- **Local Storage**: Used for storing and retrieving the list of added products to persist data even after refreshing the page.

## Features of the Project
1. **Dynamic Product Cart**: Add, view, and manage products in the cart with dynamic total cost calculation.
2. **Sort Functionality**: Sort products by price to easily find the most expensive or affordable items.
3. **Interactive Modal**: Show a payment success modal when purchasing, with the ability to close and redirect to the home page.
4. **Persistent Data Storage**: Products added to the cart are saved in local storage, maintaining state across page reloads.
5. **Responsive Design**: The project layout adapts to various screen sizes for a better user experience on mobile and desktop.
